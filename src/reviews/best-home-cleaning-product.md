Sometimes the best product is no product at all. Mixing simple distilled vinegar and water (1:1) is the best way to clean most of the hard surfaces in your home to get a spot-free, streak-free, germ-free shine.

1 part distilled white vinegar (any brand is fine) + 1 part hot water = cleaning magic

If you want to clean your windows to get a streak-free shine, kill household germs, or want your kitchen counters spotless and clean, there are seemingly a million and a half choices on the shelves of your local Walmart, Target, or Amazon. And a different batch of bottles for every conceivable household surface.

So which is the best for your everyday household cleaning?

Surprise! None of them.

**Just grab an empty clean spray bottle, and fill it with half hot water and half distilled vinegar from your kitchen**. Spray your windows, wipe with a clean cloth, and enjoy the brilliant streak-free shine.


## Cheap, spotless, streak-free, non-toxic, anti-bacterial. Magical.

Yes; the completely natural (edible!) distilled white vinegar that you can buy by the gallon for cheap from your grocery store is not only non-toxic, but its acidic composition breaks down dirty films that often accumulate on shiny surfaces at home, from your windows to your stainless steel appliances to many floors. It leaves surfaces spotless. Heck, it’s even Martha Stewart’s choice.
Oh, and it’s naturally anti-bacterial, too (that’s why it’s been used for thousands of years to pickle and preserve foods), without the danger of creating terrifying  [drug resistant super-bacteria](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/strange-but-true-antibacterial-products-may-do-more-harm-than-good/)  that can result from overuse of synthetic antibacterial chemicals. So yep, you can be green, clean, and murder harmful bacteria all at the same time!
It’s maybe not the best idea to spraying the air your loved ones breathe and coat the surfaces they touch and prepare food on with toxic chemicals that have poison control center instructions on the back of their bottles. So it feels good to be able to clean around your kitchen and house without worrying about your human, furred, or feathered friends. Spray that vinegar and water at will and indulge your clean, OCD self!
If you’re into detailed recipes for Modernthird’s top recommended household cleaning solution, here you go:

### Vinegar Household Cleaning Solution
Ingredients
* 1 part hot or warm water
* 1 part vinegar
Directions
* Add together in a clean spray bottle. Spray and wipe as needed. Done!

Some extra tips:
* Remember, vinegar is acidic (it’s a.k.a acetic acid, after all), so be careful around surfaces like granite, limestone, and marble, which acids can eat away at. Those surfaces are generally sealed (that’s why they don’t melt away when you spill some lemonade on them), and I actually use vinger cleaning solution all the time everywhere in my kitchen. But something to be aware of. You can use vinegar cleaning solution pretty indiscriminately around your house, but if you’re ever in doubt, just Google it.
* It’s amazing for car care, too. Hello shiny windows and hard surfaces.
* If you see streaks after cleaning your windows with vinegar solution, it’s not the vinegar, it’s probably residue from the old synthetic chemicals you were using before. Just repeat a few times with the vinegar spray and wiping away with a clean cloth. As you remove the chemical residues, future cleanings will be effortless and streak-less.
* If you’re worried about the smell of vinegar, keep in mind it disapates (just evaporates away) pretty quickly in addition to being much healthier for you than the fumes of chemically scented cleaning products. But more importantly, if you keep using it for a month, your smart brain will quickly make the association between vinegar smell and the spotless clean it creates, and you’ll quite enjoy the smell of true clean!
From scary cabinet of countless chemicals to clean streak-free bliss
I used to have a terrifying dark under-the-kitchen-sink cabinet filled with all manner of cleaning products, each for some super specific seperate household surface. Most which I’d use once because there were so many of them, and each seemed dangerous in its own fashion (as the fine print on the bottles would indicate). After a few months of just using vinegar cleaning solution, I was able to get rid of them all (well, except for a bottle of  [Bar Keepers Friend](http://amzn.to/2EBrUzq) , which removes rust from metal surfaces). They were all replaced with one elgeant clean spray bottle of vingar and water that we refill as needed (and now our under-sink cabinet looks like a Scandanavian clean Instagram pic).
**Vinegar-and-water cleaning solution is a nice reminder that often, the best product to buy is not buying a new product at all.** Instead, just apply some science and knowledge. And enjoy the clean!
Jump start to spotless
You probably don’t need to buy anything at all to get started getting your nautral clean on. But if you do need supplies, here are some (endlessly reusable) items that could be handy:
* Empty  [glass spray bottle](http://amzn.to/2FeD9uL)  or empty  [plastic spray bottles](http://amzn.to/2EPWxR6) . If you enjoy Pinterest-chic,  [reusable amber glass spray bottles](http://amzn.to/2FeD9uL)  sure are purty and feel good to use and see.
*  [Collapsible silcone funnel](http://amzn.to/2Cu51bt) . It’s a small thing, but having a funnel makes it effortless to get that vinegar from your $1.50 gallon jug (and the water) into your spray bottle. Once you realize how versatile vinegar cleaning solution is, you’ll be using it a lot, so you may be making more of it all the time. I use this  [food-grade silicone funnel that collapses](http://amzn.to/2Cu51bt)  to fit right into our kitchen tools drawer for handy access. And since it only touches food (yay, vinegar!), it multi-tasks perfectly for all kinds of other cooking activities (getting spices into spice jars, etc).
*  [Vinegar](http://amzn.to/2CujuUI) . Well, you do need this one. Putting the Amazon link here in case you’re into  [Prime Fresh](http://amzn.to/2ECueq2)  ( [AmazonFresh free trial](https://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&node=10329849011&tag=modern0bc-20&ref_=assoc_tag_ph_1507065544167&_encoding=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=pf4&linkId=03744fa1c2eebbe575c2cba999f846c7) ) or  [Prime Pantry](http://amzn.to/2EMZstX)  ( [Prime free trial](https://www.amazon.com/tryprimefree?ref_=assoc_tag_ph_1427739975520&_encoding=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=pf4&tag=modern0bc-20&linkId=c0768ac9f6649ad12b189fc6b5a6904b) ). But most folks can probably just pick up an entire gallon (maybe a half or full year’s worth of cleaning supplies?) for about $2 at their local grocery store. Acetic acid is acetic acid, so feel free to get the cheap store brand. Be the cleanest, healthiest, smartly-frugal person ever.
